## 📗About

**Welcome to GUI Overhaul!** This is a resource pack that **overhauls** the colors and appearance of all buttons and inventory screens, making Java Edition's GUIs more in parity with Bedrock Edition while keeping the the classic default style.

This pack comes with 2 color modes: Default and Dark, supports custom inventory screens likes barrel, ender chest and shulker boxes by using OptiGUI (most recommended) or Optifine.
